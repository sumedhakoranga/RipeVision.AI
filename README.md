# RipeVision.AI: Development of Tomato Maturity Level Prediction Software Using Advanced Artificial Intelligence Techniques

## Description

The major issue with the fruit industry is to ensure that the produce in the market is at an appropriate maturity level. The produce should not be overripe so they rot quickly, neither should they be underripe that they wonâ€™t sell. 

This project focuses on development of an accurate, successful, and user-friendly tomato ripeness detection model and application

Training dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enalis/tomatoes-dataset).

## Tech Stack and concepts used

- Python
- Kotlin
- Keras
- TensorFlow Lite
- Convolution Neural Network
- Transfer Learning

<!-- ## Setup

- Download the trained model from [here](https://github.com/sumedhakoranga/RipeVision.AI/bobs/main/models).
- Run the script and choose the model to use to translate. -->
